GoL2 is a fun and interactive way to introduce new users and developers to smart contracts written in Cairo.

With StarkNet, Game of Life transitions can be computed inside the contract, with each of the 225 cells living or dying according to the game rules. These rules are enforced by a STARK proof, which then displays the game updates to Ethereum - this means the results are guaranteed to be correct.
